Configuration Reference
=======================

The extension will automaticly include all necessary JS and CSS files. It uses a custom
DataProcessor to hook into the frame_class Variable of the content element, to extend the
Classes Attribute and not to overwrite the fluid_styled_content Default Layout Template.

Over the constants editor you can include jQuery (v3.3.1) too, if you want.
